# AI Applied Course Labs

This repository contains experiments, exercises, and learning projects developed during my Applied AI Engineering specialization.

## Purpose

This is my learning laboratory where I:

- Explore LLM fundamentals
- Experiment with embeddings and RAG
- Prototype agents and automation
- Test DevOps + AI integrations

More robust and production-ready versions of selected projects will be available in separate repositories.

## Structure (planned)

- 01-llm-foundations
- 02-embeddings
- 03-rag-experiments
- 04-agent-experiments
